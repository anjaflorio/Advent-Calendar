An Esaay I wrote when I was 16. My teacher gave me the highest grade for that year, even though I wrote it for fun. 
**Pedophilia - Sexual Orientation or Mental Disorder?**
Since the 21st century, the threshold of tolerance toward those who feel differently, in areas of sexual orientation, has greatly expanded. Gay men are no longer massacred and pumped full of hormonal medications, being lesbian is no longer considered a phase or a genre in the porn industry, and a new gender has been declared as "diverse. "The spectrum of orientations lived out today ranges from "I love only you!" to "I love all of you" (which, by the way, is referred to as polysexuality). The collective term for homogeneous reproductive interests is called LGBTQ+. An umbrella term that includes all healthy sexual preferences that are not completely hetero-based.
This raises the central question: is pedophilia included in this? Does it belong to a sexual orientation? Herein lies the controversy that members of LGBTQ+, together with today's tolerant society, debate against a subset of modern science and those affected themselves. Neither of the two parties (sexual orientation and mental disorder) wants to take pedophilia into their boat. Not surprising when one engages with the topic and the definition of this controversial phenomenon. A person who loves children. And by that, parental love is not meant, but rather sexually based passion, eros. The idea of taking a small child to oneself to live out one's fantasies. Whether a stranger or one's own. 
Typical stereotypes of such a mammal: 40-50 year old man, truck driver, married but unhappy. His wife alone can no longer satisfy his sexual fantasies. Where does he hang out? Predominantly on playgrounds or on the internet. The latter has offered, since globalization, an open media library and free choice for guilty or not guilty perpetrators. Everywhere chats can be found and children sign up, lurks one of these beings who can no longer resist their desire. This male drive, wanting to have what the masculine being desires, has its origin in the Stone Age.
Men - the hunters of humanity.
Strong, tall, and strong-willed. Actually needed to serve the protection of gentle women and children, but from time to time these abilities were used to satisfy unfulfillable urges. The protector became the destroyer (of course, this does not apply to the entire species of man). This image is no longer strongly supported in today's generation. Keyword: emancipation. Nevertheless, some melancholics of past times continuously reinforce this view.Absurd to think one can get everything through force. Success rates prove, however, that it works. Shocking events show, however, that it works. 
Not too long ago, I started an experiment myself. I registered on a chat portal known as a digital playground for pedophiles. I pretended to be the 11-year-old Luisa. Typical prey pattern - young and feminine. After half an hour, 60 potential offenders wrote to me who de facto wanted to send me a picture of their genitals. "Ooh, your bikini is really tight, why don't you take it off" "Have you ever had sex, you're welcome to have your first time with me." Sexting with children who don't even know what real sex is, even storing it as "making love" in their vocabulary. 
In consideration of such sentences, I ask myself how some followers of science come up with the idea to define such a thing as a normative sexual orientation and why, to this day, it is not seen as a mental disorder that should have its place in therapy. Not too easy to treat something that remains hidden, I admit. But how can one think that something like this is normal? How can SCIENCE share such a view? 
Science justifies its thesis with the statement that pedophiles are sexually attracted to children, just as gay men are to men. With the one difference that with pedophilia, there is a disease behind it. Otherwise, everything plays out the same: They feel the same fantasy with regard to security and want a life filled with acceptance. But then why does it belong to abnormality? Why does a shiver run down your spine, just like mine, when one imagines that these men (rarely also women) wish to go to bed with an 11-year-old child and engage in hanky-panky there? Because we don't want our children to be affected, or because it's unfamiliar, due to the fact that it's not frequently discussed? 
An interview with a pedophile made me think about whether this person is also just a human being, like you and me. "We all love, albeit in different ways." This anonymized gentleman spoke of how, if this occurrence were repeatedly discussed and we deconstructed the prejudices against them, the current thinking and actions of society would change. Pedophiles would have less/no shame and would talk more extensively and confidently about their desires to help themselves and to avoid criminal acts. They would dare to address it, a coming-out. They would feel acceptance, a feeling of solidarity that makes them think twice about whether they will now demolish this child or not. However, they will never be able to change their feelings. Just as you cannot fall in love with the same gender with the blink of an eye (let alone you already do) or vice versa. 
Who one loves is not changeable. Who one sexually harasses and to whom/whether one inflicts harm, on the other hand, is. And here another controversy emerges. 
Are pedophiles really mentally disturbed and unstable and thus unable to differentiate between what is right and wrong? If not, it would look different in criminal prosecution. As is widely known, there is a restriction for mentally disturbed offenders regarding the duration of imprisonment. If pedophilia were a recognized mental disorder, they could get out of the matter more unhindered. Thus, the punishment could fall to just probation. So we should also carefully consider, from a criminal law perspective (not just sociological and psychological), which definition makes sense and really applies, instead of simply using a term to push it aside or clear it out of the way. Would you, as a parent, aunt, grandparent, or affected person, want the punishment to be lower? After all, the saying goes: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
One approach to dealing with this duplicity is the useful differentiation between perpetrator and pedophile. Pedophile does not equal perpetrator. These are two different pairs of shoes. One can arise from the other, but only when no help is available. Depression does not equal suicidality; it develops from it when no help is available. But is help a matter of society, or is it easier to pull it into the negative and thus eliminate it from subjective reality and simply declare it as an orientation?
Society reacts just as absent to this as to the possibility of helping. Wanting to go to bed with a child? Should that become normal, like being gay and lesbian became? -No. Nevertheless, anything can happen. Just as mass murder of gay people was committed in World War II, today there are specialized gay clubs and dedicated dating apps! Is it conceivable that we will implement pedophilia, despite our modern devaluation, as an everyday phenomenon in the foreseeable future? Modern society says: No - pedophiles out! We cannot allow such a thing to be seen as normal and fall into the collective term of sexual orientation. We cannot do this to children and at the same time tolerate it. Such an absurdity has no place in our era.
So where to put it... deport? Put in psychiatry? Kill? Such thinking was already applied in the 20th century, during Hitler's time. We all know what resulted from that.
Nevertheless, we want nothing to do with pedophilia, although we contribute a part to it. Parents who post vacation photos of their children or don't pay attention to what their children themselves post. The police, who undertake little or can undertake little against child pornography, or the aversion to discussing the topic. All these things serve as a gateway drug for potentially becoming perpetrators. Like cannabis in the drug scene. After most occurrences one hears, like the sexual abuse cases in the church, one becomes increasingly aware - a change is needed. No more pigeonhole thinking between "He can't help it, it's his sexual preference" and "He is mentally disturbed, without help he can't do anything about it." Both, in my view, are wrong. Every person is responsible for their own actions. As guilty as perpetrators are, so are we. As little as he does against it, so do we. And as closed as we talk about it, so does he. Contempt alone is not the solution. But one thing is clear:
Pedophilia cannot be counted as a healthy sexual orientation - it is sick. A sick sexual orientation. Both debating parties can agree on that. An orientation that we should block with understanding, even if without acceptance.
It needs help. Potential victims need help. Society needs help.
