# mattress

I got myself a 1.80m mattress, hoping we could lie on it forever. But i think it was too big. You slid to the corner and created distance. Now at night I reach out my arm and feel like it's just not long enough. Then I wake up crying hysterically and realize a big mattress doesn't heal my back pain. It just brings emptiness.
