Today, I want to share a piece of poetry that reflects my feelings for you.

**Whispers of the Heart**

In the quiet of the night,  
When stars begin to gleam,  
I find your laughter echoing,  
Like a sweet, enchanting dream.

Your eyes, they hold the universe,  
A galaxy of light,  
With every glance, you pull me in,  
And make the darkness bright.

Through every storm and shadow,  
Your love is my guiding star,  
No distance can divide us,  
No matter where we are.

So here’s my heart, my darling,  
Wrapped in words so true,  
Each line a gentle promise,  
Forever, I choose you.

I hope this resonates with you as much as you resonate with me.
