# When collapse feels like freedom - a memoire to the me I never get to be

I don't want the world to end out of malice. I want it to end because it's the only scenario where I stop being owned. Owned by obligations, structures, the endless performance of being acceptable, functional, sane. In a world where everything's collapsing, I am finally not the reason why. In collapse, I'm finally innocent. In ruin, I'm finally unburdened.
In my mind the world collapses quietly at first, then violenty honest. It peels open. No more screens. No more digital gods demanding allegiance. No more gods at all. Only the raw mathemtics of survival. In an ending world, I'm no longer responsible for performing the right emotions, the right choices. Humans would relearn the important things the living has forgotten.
My trauma hardwires become actual skills, holy weapons. Hyper-awareness, self-sufficiency, vigilance, quietness, internal planning. The world would finally match the intensity I grew up with. 
I see myself cultivating plants because hunger doesn't negotiate. The soil is real, it never pretends to love you. I feed it, or I die. My hands are real. Oh how my fingers would root into the dirt like curses made flesh... I rebuild machines stripped bare by time. Not for a resume, not for approval or university. But for the sheer clarity of something that either works or doesn't. A language the living world has forgotten. I like to build. I build because no one ever built a safe world for me. 
I save people because I choose to, not because a system manipulates me into caring, guilt-tripping me with moralty or obligation. But I care so much... Even for the metaphorical monsters I lived with long before any undead ones showed up. 
And I kill the dead. Brutally, the way honesty feels in my mouth. I violently kill feral bodies staggering through ruins because some part of me needs a place to put my rage. Not onto the living, but onto something that can take it, something that deserves to be crushed. And I don't apologize. In the apocalypse my anger finally has teeth. It's allowed to exist, punch, roar. I'm no longer forced to compress it into silence or politeness. I wan't to freely despise my mother's boyfriend. I want to ferociously kill my rapist.
The abandoned stores belong to nobody. I take what I need, want and can carry. Nothing takes from me instead. And for the first time in a lifetime, time itself stops haunting me. Tik-tok.
There's no internet. No buzzing hive of shallow thoughts. Only books, heavy, quiet, mortal. Pages that don't scream for my attention. Pages that wait, let me breathe, unlike the 98 unread messages on my phone.
Maybe this fantasy isn't only about zombies. Maybe it's about permission. To build what I want, instead of bend. To cultivate instead of perform. To exist without capitalism breathing down my neck like an asthmatic senior. To read, to create, be quite and slow. To live a life measured in moments. Not deadlines, expectations or adult-childhood baggage and inherited wounds. Permission for my competences to be a currency, not a burden, a curse or a weapon turned against me. 
Maybe this is the core of it: I don't actually hunger for death. I hunger for the life stripped of performance. Life with the fat cut off. Simplicity sharpened into meaning. Where the fight is real, and so am I. 
I want to start over... In a world broken enough that I can finally rebuild it, and doing so
rebuild myself.
