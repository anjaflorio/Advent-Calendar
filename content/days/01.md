# Day 01

This song is called "You were my home".

**Translated Lyrics:**

You say “It’s all yesterday’s snow (It’s all water under the bridge)”
But you throw it at me
I look at you in bed with him
Where have the feelings gone?
Your “I want to change for you”
is changing who I am
Because, even if what you had with him wasn’t serious
you take what makes the relationship serious.

You were my home
Now I’m moving, and moving alone
I had to share my key
I don’t dare to enter with mine anymore
You were my home
Now I don’t have a place to live

You can’t throw anything at me anymore
I’ve built new walls
And we can’t become anything anymore
I won’t give you a key to my new house
I see the snow has melted
and you don’t hurt me no more
I hope he helped you understand
what you still need

You were my home
Now I’m moving, and moving alone
I had to share my key
I don’t dare to enter with mine anymore
You were my home
Now I don’t have a place to live

I was your home
Now look around, you’re alone
Everything that warmed you was mine
But you rather fall asleep with snowmen
You were my home
Until I came and cried

**Thoughts:**
This songs depicts my fear of being cheated on with a man again. I'm always scared that something's missing. An Aubergine or the sense of safety and acceptance that society grants to heterosexual relationships. I'm haunted by the constant worry that I can never be enough, that something fundamental is missing in me. I feel like I'm always competing with something I can never be. It's the fear that no matter how deep our connection is, there will always be a longing for what only a man can provide.
