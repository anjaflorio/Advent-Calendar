# I Am Sober - May 25th 2023

“Why should you stop hurting yourself?” 
I don’t know why I should stop. My therapist says it’s not good for me.
But it feels good for me. It simply doesn’t fit the norm. It frees me.
Like pulling that lump out of your throat.
Like taking off your bra after a long day.
Like that one day when you’re leaving for vacation and nothing goes wrong.
A foot massage after eight hours of work on a Saturday.
Throwing up after drinking too much.
An organsm.
Turning the ceiling lights off.
A hot bathtub in winter.
Lying in bed with her.
I’m realizing… I’ve just listed things I could be doing instead.
