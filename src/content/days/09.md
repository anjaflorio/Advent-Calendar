# Aris
NOTE| It was very hard for me to re-read this and I still cry when I do. This is a very personal insight and I feel terribly sharing this. I've been carrying this guilt around with me for years. Maybe that's why I don't like dogs.

Aris, I remember the day they took you away from me. You were afraid. Afraid of having to stay with me. 
I’m sorry, Aris. 
I laughed at you when you spun in circles too many times, begging, eyes locked on the treat.
I pushed you down the sofa, because I enjoyed the sound of your nails scratching the fabric. The sound of something wanting to be near me, something trusting, craving. And me, refusing it. Refusing because I could.
I hit you when you shat in the basement because no one had taken you outside. Or showed you mercy. You had no choice. You knew, while you pushed, that you would be punished for it. The basement floor beneath your small paws, cold and wet. I wanted you to learn to hold it in, because I couldn't. I wanted control over you, because I had none over myself. I didn't teach you anything except fear. I didn't change you. I only changed my own damage into the space between us. Yet out of politeness, you choose the basement. A secret place to hide the damage I'd done. As if your suffering needed to protect me from shame. I beat the shit inside of you. 
I’m sorry, Aris. 
I loved you the only way I had learned: the way my father loved anything smaller than him. Violently, ignorantly, desperately. 
I remember him throwing the cat off the balcony because she didn’t like you. She came back once. After that, she jumped on her own. Died. 
Can animals commit suicide? Do animals feel despair deep enough to die for it? Do you still live somewhere? Or did the upbringing of a 9-year-old kill you slowly, day after day? Did my hands, my ignorance, my rage, my love kill you before life could? Is your tail still tucked between your legs, even now? Please tell me you can feel joy again. Tell me I didn’t shatter everything soft inside you. 
I used to believe I’d never forget your dog-face. I memorized details so I could recognize you among a thousand dogs. I knew you’d leave eventually. Nothing stays in a house like mine.
But humans forget. Even the things they swear they wont. I forget. I wouldn’t recognize you now. But I will never forget what I did to you.  
Aris, the only reason you name a dog is so you can tell it what to do. I told you to leave many times, with my blooming red palms. With my voice far too young to already know how to scream like that. With eyes too unformed to process what they were seeing. 
I looked away from you because once you look something in the face, it starts wanting things from you. It accepts any sort of tenderness and company, even disguised as sweaty hands bruising everything they touch. 
I looked away because I couldn’t watch the suffering I caused.
I understand now, what you needed. Because I needed it too. Sometimes I imagine myself as a dog, as you, as any dog I encounter. I am too a stray in my own house, abandoned in the basement, eternally and senselessly waiting for someone to return. 
Leash me. I’m begging you. Put a collar on me, so tight it burns through my fur and blisters my skin. I wont bite, I promise. I will not resist. I will learn what you taught me. Loyalty, endurance, longing. I will crawl to the edge of the world if you call. I will lie in the dirt and wait for your forgiveness. 
Loyal dogs, they dont just leave. I wish my basement were full of shit again. At least then, even in my cruelty something survived. Someone had been here.
