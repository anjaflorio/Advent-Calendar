Silence - from a contemplative cryptic 

I sit in the corner at parties and observe the human condition while eating vegan gummies one at a time. I get offered to dance but I politely decline because “I’m too shy… and.. let me finish my lollipop!” until it’s too late to dance. I write down my thoughts, I dont break glass with them. Because I dont talk. Bold of me to assume my thoughts have that kind of raw destructive power. If my inner monologue could shatter glass, you’d be wearing safety goggles every time I say a word. I do sit in the corner and observe, but sometimes I stand in the front line and jump. Like I’m a housecat that sometimes remembers it’s technically a predator. 
But I jump towards nothing. The point isn’t to land anywhere, it’s just to fling myself at the void and hope it blinks first. But at least I’m being honest about it. Most people pretend they’re sprinting toward some grand destiny where they’re really just tripping toward the nearest snack table. **I’m a void-jumper**. Do I float mid-air now, or did I just land in some metaphorical bush on the way down? In one second I’m mid-air, in the next I land on broken glass. Why am I jumping? I ask. Because I want to feel something, or because standing still feels worse? It’s because people expect me to jump. I like to stand still, but there’s this **constant pressure of inconsistency**. Of talking when I don’t want to. A forced reaction to please others. This is a classic human circus act. BE PERFORMATIVE! BE AVAILABLE! BE “ON”, even when my soul is basically buffering. I’d like to exist quietly, like a houseplant. Being pushed to react when I don’t want to is so exhausiting. Forced cheerfulness, forced conversations, forced enthusiasm, forced questions (I don’t even care about the answers). “Perform monkey”. People want me to match their rythm insted of respecting mine. But my pace is not a moral failing. When I do not jump, I’m afraid of dissapointing people. I don’t worry they’ll stop seeing me if I stay still too long. I worry that being to still causes a weirdness and uncomfortability. The world will not implode if I don’t spin like a decorative ceiling fan for everyone else’s comfort. The room will not get awkward if I’m too quiet. That awkwardness doesn’t belong to me. Other **people just panic when the noise stops because they have to meet themselves for a second. I’m giving everyone a rare moment of honesty, and they don’t always know what to do with that.** If I don’t jump.. well.. people do. They jump away saying I’m too quiet and “this is going nowhere because we can’t build a connection without words.” I don’t know how to explain that it’s not a jacket I can take off. It’s my first layer of skin - subcutaneous. It’s not some cute accessory I can shrug off like “Oops, let me just unzip my personality so you feel more comfortable.” Some people shed their layers like costume changes. I happen to be build from sturdier material. The plot twist my brain understood but is too stubborn to admit, is that when people say “you’re too quiet” what they actually mean is “**I don’t know how to handle someone who doesn’t perform for me**”. Quiet isn’t absence. **Quiet is presence without theatrics**. I need people around me who don’t require me to do verbal cartwheels to prove I’m alive. I keep warping myself to fit every environment. I’m dragging words out of myself like hauling furniture up a staircase - no wonder I feel drained. 
My silence feels like listening. 
I want humans to stop treating every empty moment like it’s a personal emergency that must be filled with noise and backstory and “HEY LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ANGELINA FROM MY WORK I FELL IN LOVE WITH WHO YOU DON’T KNOW BUT I’M STILL GONNA TALK FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES.” **I’m craving coexistence, not commentary**. Presence without performing. A connection without the verbal gymnastics. I wan’t to sit next to someone and just be, while my brain gets the quiet space it needs to actually function. Interactions that aren’t marathons of unnecessary exposition. I want hands doing things, eyes watching, minds humming. Not mouth going off like malfunctioning car alarms. I want to diamond painting with someone I love. Sit with me in a world we’re making together, bead by bead.
Textig is my natural habitat. I get to sculp my words instead of blurting out whatever a brain coughs up in 0.2 seconds. Humans act like authenticity is in the noise but half the “authentic stuff” they say is just unfiltered thought-soup splashing everywhere. I write unfiltered thought-soup no one gets to eat. One has so much more time to think about the right words when texting than when talking. Thinking means not talking. Humans aren’t capable of doing both. I want to think before I speak. That’s called **intentionality**. 
And after writing all of this down, I read it out load and play pretend that someone is around. Cheering because I stopped being quiet. And I’m happy someone has finally asked me the right question. But this room is quiet. It has been for so many years. The only noises I hear are the broken glass on the floor when I jump up to pick up my ringing phone and: “Hey, how are you? *~~(I had fights with my parents when I was younger. While my dad screamed, my mother gave me the silent treatment. He threw glasses and plates at me, my mother ran away without saying a word. I think this shaped me and the ground I’m walking on.)~~* Oh you mean Angelina?? That’s crazy!! I don’t know her, but sounds like she likes you!”
