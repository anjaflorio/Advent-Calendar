# ”Wir müssten uns doch näher als sonst stehen, wenn zwischen uns nichts mehr passt.”
We should stand closer than ever, if nothing else fits between us anymore.

Meaning:
If nothing fits between us anymore, then our bodies would have to be close together. Our distance is so small that not even air, doubt, or anything else can be/stand/slip between us.
In German „Zwischen uns passt nichts mehr“ is a euphemism meaning there is tension, we don’t see eye to eye, something is wrong between us, arguments, unsaid things exist.
When someone says this, they’re meaning the relationship is strained. Not that you are physically close, but emotionally blocked.
If nothing “fits” between us anymore, if tension and conflict leave no space, then maybe the only possible reaction is to come closer, not further apart. To stand face to face instead of back to back. Let the lack of space draw us together instead of pushing us away.
It transforms something usually negative into a desire for intimacy.
If everything between us is stuck, broken, tight, painful, let it force us into deeper closeness instead of separation.
