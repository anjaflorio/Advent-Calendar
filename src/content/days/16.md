# The bill

I should write you a bill for all the love i have waisted on you. but you couldnt pay it , because you’d have to pay with yours (and you dont love me anymore)

- love = currency, something with value that can be counted, charged, invoiced. My love wasnt free. It cost me time, energy, emotion, pieces of myself
- debt = you took and took. there's a sense of injustice, of emotional labor done without compensation.
You couldn’t pay the bill,
because the only currency accepted is love,
and you don’t love me anymore.
I don’t want their apology, or excuses. I want the love back that you poured into someone who can no longer return anything.
