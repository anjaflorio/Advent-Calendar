# Song "Moving out, moving on"
(sequel "You were my home" Feb. 2025)

Moving out, moving on. Thought we'd do it together. As I lock the door, you knock on the window and start laughing. I pack your things into boxes because you no longer have a place here. I set fire to the house we built together and am amazed how fine I am.
Letting go, making space. Create new room for new love.
New plants, new furniture, and a new man. A new me who can finally breathe.
Arriving, getting along. Never thought I could do it without you. As you look through my new window, you see me laughing in the mirror. I take my things out of the boxes and make a mess because I deserve to. I put new plans on the table, this time I'm building without you. I'm so glad I'm doing well.
Letting go, making space. Create new room for new love.
New plants, new furniture, and a new man. A new me who can finally breathe.
**I knew you weren't my home when I helped you move out.**
