# „Dir ist es so leicht gefallen, mir zu versprechen, dass du bleibst. Aber alles, was leichtfällt, kann schneller brechen.“

You promised me so easily that you would stay.
But everything that comes without weight can break without resistance.

The first sentence "You promised me so easily that you would stay" is a painful realization. The promise to stay comes effortlessly, too effortlessy. As if it costs nothing. No struggle, no thought, no emotional weight. That lightness becomes suspicious. Promises that are made too easily are often the ones we can't trust. 
The second sentence "But everything that comes without weight can break without resistance" turns that ease into a metaphor: What is effortless is often unstable, what is light is often fragile, what is quick to give is quick to break.
If that promise didn’t weigh anything for you, it also didn’t hold.
And because it was weightless, it shattered the fastest.
The beauty lies in the contrast: "leicht fallen" - to come easy (to fall easy) and "schnell brechen" - to break quickly. I turned lightness into a symbol of impermanence.
